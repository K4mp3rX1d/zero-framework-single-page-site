# zero-framework-single-page-site

This will be a single page site. And there will be no third party frameworks.
This will be build using features inherently available through css. And with vanilla Javascript.

This isn't going to be a serious project. This project is actually for practicing purpose.
This is sort of a playground for implementing what I'll learn on my WD journey.
